<b>Rules in volleyball:</b>

1. Team Composition:
   - Each team consists of six players on the court at any time, with positions including setters, outside hitters, middle blockers, opposite hitters, and liberos.

2. Game Duration:
   - Matches are typically played in a best-of-five sets format. The first four sets are played to 25 points, and the fifth set (if needed) is played to 15 points. A team must win a set by at least two points.

3. Scoring:
   - Points are scored through rally scoring, meaning a point is awarded on every serve, regardless of which team served. The receiving team can score a point by winning a rally.

4. Starting Play:
   - The game starts with a serve from behind the end line. The server must not step on or over the line until the ball is in play.

5. Rotations:
   - Players must rotate clockwise every time their team wins the serve from the opponent. The positions are left front, center front, right front, right back, center back, and left back.

6. Ball Handling:
   - Players are allowed to touch the ball three times per side (excluding a block touch) to return it over the net. The touches usually follow the sequence of bump, set, and spike.

### Violations:

1. Double Hit:
   - A player may not hit the ball twice consecutively unless the first touch was a block.

2. Lift/Carry:
   - The ball must be hit cleanly and not caught or thrown.

3. Foot Fault:
   - The server must not step on or over the end line before hitting the ball. Similarly, players must not step on the centerline or into the opponent's court.

4. Net Violation:
   - Players must not touch the net or step over the centerline under the net during play.

5. Back-Row Attack:
   - A back-row player cannot attack the ball above the net’s height if they jump from in front of the attack line (3-meter or 10-foot line).

### Fouls:

1. Blocking:
   - Front-row players can block the ball at the net, but they cannot touch the ball across the net if the opponent has not yet made an attacking hit.

2. Overreach:
   - Players cannot reach over the net to attack the ball if it’s still in the opponent’s court.

3. Attack Hit Fault:
   - An attack hit is considered a fault if the ball lands out of bounds, is carried, or if the attacker commits a net violation.

### Game Structure:

1. Substitutions:
   - Teams are allowed a limited number of substitutions per set (usually 6 to 12 depending on the league), except for the libero, who can replace any back-row player without it counting as a substitution.

2. Timeouts:
   - Each team is typically allowed two timeouts per set, each lasting 30 seconds.

3. Service Order:
   - Teams must follow the correct rotational order, and the order must be maintained throughout the set. Incorrect rotations result in a loss of rally and a point for the opposing team.

4. Libero:
   - The libero is a defensive specialist who cannot attack the ball above the net's height and cannot serve, block, or attempt to block. The libero wears a different color jersey for easy identification.
